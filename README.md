revorb
======

A remake of the [old revorb](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,64328.0.html/)
that compiles [ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg) on non-Windows platforms.

## Building

You'll probably need to install the write libraries with brew or apt-get or what not.

```bash
$ brew install libogg libvorbis
```

Then you can just run `make`.
